# machine-learning-film-style-analysis
A data repository of the film style data which may serve as input to machine learning techniques employed to distinguish between the styles of silent and sound films.

# Repository content

The repository contains the following analysis documents:

1. The labelled silent-sound shot scale data set.
2. The original film style data made available by Barry Salt which served as the raw data input to the data cleaning and formatting procedure prior to conducting the silent-sound classification analysis.
3. A document briefly describing the hyper parameter tuning procedure and results in respect of the machine learning models employed in the silent-sound classification analysis.
4. The Python script that was used to perform the hyper parameter tuning of the MLP model as an example of the application of the random search and Bayesian optimisation methods.
